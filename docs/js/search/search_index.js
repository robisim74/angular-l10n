It allows, in addition to translation, to format dates and numbers through Internationalization API\nDocumentation\nAngular l10n Specification\nArchitecture\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInstallation\nUsage\nTypes\nIntl API\nPrevious versions\nContributing\nLicense\n\nInstallation\nnpm install angular-l10n --save Usage\nYou can find a complete sample app here, and a live example on StackBlitz.\nConfiguration\nCreate the configuration:\nexport const l10nConfig: L10nConfig = {\n    format: 'language-region',\n    providers: [\n        { name: 'app', asset: i18nAsset }\n    ],\n    cache: true,\n    keySeparator: '.',\n    defaultLocale: { language: 'en-US', currency: 'USD' },\n    schema: [\n        { locale: { language: 'en-US', currency: 'USD' }, dir: 'ltr', text: 'United States' },\n        { locale: { language: 'it-IT', currency: 'EUR' }, dir: 'ltr', text: 'Italia' }\n    ]\n};\n\nexport function initL10n(l10nLoader: L10nLoader): () => Promise {\n    return () => l10nLoader.init();\n}\n\nconst i18nAsset = {\n    'en-US': {\n        greeting: \"Hello world!\",\n        whoIAm: \"I am {{name}}\"\n    },\n    'it-IT': {\n        greeting: \"Ciao mondo!\",\n        whoIAm: \"Sono {{name}}\"\n    }\n};Import the modules and the configuration:\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        L10nTranslationModule.forRoot(l10nConfig),\n        L10nIntlModule\n    ],\n    providers: [\n        {\n            provide: APP_INITIALIZER,\n            useFactory: initL10n,\n            deps: [L10nLoader],\n            multi: true\n        }\n    ],\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Getting the translation\nPure Pipes\n{{ 'greeting' | translate:locale.language }}\n{{ 'whoIAm' | translate:locale.language:{ name: 'Angular l10n' } }}\n\n{{ today | l10nDate:locale.language:{ dateStyle: 'full', timeStyle: 'short' } }}\n\n{{ value | l10nNumber:locale.language:{ digits: '1.2-2', style: 'currency' } }}Pure pipes need to know when the locale changes. So import L10nLocale injection token in the component:\nexport class AppComponent {\n\n    constructor(@Inject(L10N_LOCALE) public locale: L10nLocale) { }\n\n}OnPush Change Detection Strategy\nTo support this strategy, there is an async version of each pipe:\n{{ 'greeting' | translateAsync }}Directives\ngreeting\nwhoIAm\nwhoIAm -->\n\n{{ today }}\n{{ value }}You can dynamically change parameters and expressions values as with pipes, but not in attributes.\nAPIs\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit {\n\n    constructor(private translation: L10nTranslationService, private intl: L10nIntlService) { }\n\n    ngOnInit() {\n        this.translation.onChange().subscribe({\n            next: () => {\n                this.greeting = this.translation.translate('greeting');\n                this.whoIAm = this.translation.translate('whoIAm', { name: 'Angular l10n' });\n\n                this.formattedToday = this.intl.formatDate(this.today, { dateStyle: 'full', timeStyle: 'short' });\n                this.formattedValue = this.intl.formatNumber(this.value, { digits: '1.2-2', style: 'currency' });\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n}Customize the library\nThe following features can be customized. You just have to implement the indicated class-interface and pass the token during configuration.\nE.g.\n@Injectable() export class HttpTranslationLoader implements L10nTranslationLoader {\n\n    private headers = new HttpHeaders({ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });\n\n    constructor(@Optional() private http: HttpClient) { }\n\n    public get(language: string, provider: L10nProvider): Observable {\n        const url = `${provider.asset}-${language}.json`;\n        const options = {\n            headers: this.headers,\n            params: new HttpParams().set('v', provider.options.version)\n        };\n        return this.http.get(url, options);\n    }\n\n}\n\nexport const l10nConfig: L10nConfig = {\n    ...\n    providers: [\n        { name: 'app', asset: './assets/i18n/app', options: { version: '1.0.0' } },\n    ],\n    ...\n};\n\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        L10nTranslationModule.forRoot(\n            l10nConfig,\n            {\n                translationLoader: HttpTranslationLoader\n            }\n        )\n    ],\n    ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Storage\nBy default, the library does not store the locale. To store it implement the L10nStorage class-interface, so that the next time the user has the locale he selected.\nUser Language\nBy default, the library attempts to set the locale using the user's browser language, before falling back on the default locale. You can change this behavior by implementing the L10nUserLanguage class-interface, for example to get the language via server.\nTranslation Loader\nBy default, you can only pass JavaScript objects as translation data provider. To implement a different loader, you can implement the L10nTranslationLoader class-interface, as in the example above.\nTranslation Fallback\nYou can enable translation fallback during configuration:\nexport const l10nConfig: L10nConfig = {\n    ...\n    fallback: true,\n    ...\n};By default, the translation data will be merged in the following order:\n\n'language'\n'language[-script]'\n'language[-script][-region]'\n\nTo change it, implement the L10nTranslationFallback class-interface.\nTranslation Handler\nBy default, the library only parse the params. L10nTranslationHandler is the class-interface to implement to modify the behavior.\nMissing Translation Handler\nIf a key is not found, the same key is returned. To return a different value, you can implement the L10nMissingTranslationHandler class-interface.\nValidation\nThere are two directives, that you can use with Template driven or Reactive forms: l10nValidateNumber and l10nValidateDate. To use them, you have to implement the L10nValidation class-interface, and import it with the validation module:\n@Injectable() export class LocaleValidation implements L10nValidation {\n\n    constructor(@Inject(L10N_LOCALE) private locale: L10nLocale) { }\n\n    public parseNumber(value: string, options?: L10nNumberFormatOptions, language = this.locale.numberLanguage || this.locale.language): number | null {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    public parseDate(value: string, options?: L10nDateTimeFormatOptions, language = this.locale.dateLanguage || this.locale.language): Date | null {\n        ...\n    }\n\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        L10nValidationModule.forRoot({ validation: LocaleValidation })\n    ],\n    ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Routing\nYou can enable the localized routing importing the routing module after others:\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        L10nRoutingModule.forRoot()\n    ],\n    ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }A prefix containing the language is added to the path of each navigation, creating a semantic URL:\nbaseHref/[language][-script][-region]/path\n\nhttps://example.com/en/home\nhttps://example.com/en-US/homeIf the localized link is called, the locale is also set automatically.\nTo achieve this, the router configuration in your app is not rewritten: the URL is replaced, in order to provide the different localized contents both to the crawlers and to the users that can refer to the localized links.\nIf you don't want a localized routing for default locale, you can enable it during the configuration:\nexport const l10nConfig: L10nConfig = {\n    ...\n    defaultRouting: true\n};Lazy loading\nIf you want to add new providers to a lazy loaded module, you can use L10nResolver in your routing module:\nconst routes: Routes = [\n    ...\n    {\n        path: 'lazy',\n        loadChildren: () => import('./lazy/lazy.module').then(m => m.LazyModule),\n        resolve: { l10n: L10nResolver },\n        data: {\n            l10nProviders: [{ name: 'lazy', asset: './assets/i18n/lazy', options: { version: '1.0.0' } }]\n        }\n    }\n];Always import the modules you need:\n@NgModule({\n    declarations: [LazyComponent],\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        L10nTranslationModule\n    ]\n})\nexport class LazyModule { }Caching\nEnable caching during configuration if you want to prevent reloading of the already loaded translation data:\nexport const l10nConfig: L10nConfig = {\n    ...\n    cache: true\n};Preloading data\nIf you need to preload some translation data, for example to use for missing values, L10nTranslationService exposes the translation data in the data attribute. You can merge data by calling the addData method:\nexport function l10nPreload(translation: L10nTranslationService, translationLoader: L10nTranslationLoader): () => Promise {\n    return () => new Promise((resolve) => {\n        translationLoader.get('en-US', { name: 'app', asset: './assets/i18n/app', options: { version: '1.0.0' } })\n            .subscribe({\n                next: (data) => translation.addData(data, 'en-US'),\n                complete: () => resolve()\n            });\n    });\n}Then add the function to providers, before initL10n:\nproviders: [\n    {\n        provide: APP_INITIALIZER,\n        useFactory: l10nPreload,\n        deps: [L10nTranslationService, L10nTranslationLoader],\n        multi: true\n    },\n    ...\n],Types\nAngular l10n types that it is useful to know:\n\nL10nLocale: contains a language, in the format language[-script][-region][-extension], where:\n\nlanguage: ISO 639 two-letter or three-letter code\n\nscript: ISO 15924 four-letter script code\n\nregion: ISO 3166 two-letter, uppercase code\n\nextension: 'u' (Unicode) extensions\nOptionally:\n\ndateLanguage: alternative language to translate dates\n\nnumberLanguage: alternative language to translate numbers\n\ncurrency: ISO 4217 three-letter code\n\ntimezone: from the IANA time zone database\n\n\n\nL10nFormat: shows the format of the language to be used for translations. The supported formats are: 'language' | 'language-script' | 'language-region' | 'language-script-region'. So, for example, you can have a language like en-US-u-ca-gregory-nu-latn to format dates and numbers, but only use the en-US for translations setting 'language-region'\n\nL10nDateTimeFormatOptions: the type of options used to format dates. Extends the Intl DateTimeFormatOptions interface, adding the dateStyle and timeStyle attributes\n\nL10nNumberFormatOptions: the type of options used to format numbers. Extends the Intl NumberFormatOptions interface, adding the digits attribute\n\n\nIntl API\nTo format dates and numbers, this library uses the Intl API\nCheck the current browser support:\n\nECMAScript compatibility tables\nCan I use\n\nAll modern browsers have implemented this API. You can use a polyfill like Polyfill.io to extend support to old browsers.\nJust add one script tag in your index.html:\nWhen specifying the features, you have to specify what languages to load.\nOther polyfills:\n\nFor timezone: Intl.DateTimeFormat timezone\nFor timeAgo pipe and directive: Intl.RelativeTimeFormat\n\nThe L10nIntlService also provides methods for other APIs, such as Collator, PluralRules and ListFormat.\nPrevious versions\n\nAngular v8 (Angular l10n v8.1.2)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v7 (Angular l10n v7.2.0)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v6 (Angular l10n v5.2.0)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v5 (Angular l10n v4.2.0)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v4 (Angular l10n v3.5.2)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v2 (Angular l10n v2.0.11)\n\nBranch\n\n\n\nContributing\n\nBuilding the library:\n  npm install\n  npm run build\nTesting:\n  npm test\nServing the sample app:\n  npm start\n\nLicense\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2015 Roberto Simonetti\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
