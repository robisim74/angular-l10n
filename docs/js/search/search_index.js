Give the providers an empty array, but provide the supported locales in the schema anyway\n\nImport the modules and the configuration:\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        L10nTranslationModule.forRoot(l10nConfig),\n        L10nIntlModule\n    ],\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Getting the translation\nPure Pipes\n\n{{ 'greeting' | translate:locale.language }}\n\n{{ 'greeting' | translate:locale.language }}\n\n\n\n{{ 'whoIAm' | translate:locale.language:{ name: 'Angular l10n' } }}\n\n\n\n{{ today | l10nDate:locale.language:{ dateStyle: 'full', timeStyle: 'short' } }}\n\n\n\n{{ -4 | l10nTimeAgo:locale.language:'second':{ numeric:'always', style:'long' } }}\n\n\n\n{{ 1000 | l10nNumber:locale.language:{ digits: '1.2-2', style: 'currency' } }}\n\n\n\n{{ 1000 | l10nNumber:locale.language:{ digits: '1.2-2', style: 'currency' }:locale.currency:convertCurrency:{ rate: 1.16 } }}\n\n\n\n{{ 1 | l10nNumber:locale.language:{ digits: '1.0-2', style: 'unit', unit: locale.units['length'] }:undefined:convertLength }}\n\n\n\n{{ 2 | l10nPlural:locale.language:'devs':{ type: 'cardinal' } }}\n\n\n\n{{ 'en-US' | l10nDisplayNames:locale.language:{ type: 'language' } }}\nPure pipes need to know when the locale changes. So import L10nLocale injection token in every component that uses them:\nexport class PipeComponent {\n\n    constructor(@Inject(L10N_LOCALE) public locale: L10nLocale) { }\n\n}or if you prefer the shortest inject function:\nexport class PipeComponent {\n\n    locale = inject(L10N_LOCALE);\n\n}Convert function\nAn optional function to convert the value of numbers, with the same value, locale and destructured optional parameters in the signature:\nexport const convertCurrency = (value: number, locale: L10nLocale, rate: number) => {\n    switch (locale.currency) {\n        case \"USD\":\n            return value * rate;\n        default:\n            return value;\n    }\n};OnPush Change Detection Strategy\nTo support this strategy, there is an Async version of each pipe, which recognizes by itself when the locale changes:\n{{ 'greeting' | translateAsync }}Directives\n\ngreeting\n\ngreeting\n\nwhoIAm\n\n\n{{ today }}\n\n\n-4\n\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\nen-USYou can dynamically change parameters and expressions values as with pipes, but not in attributes.\nAPIs\nL10nTranslationService provides an onChange event, which is fired whenever the locale changes.\nexport class ApiComponent implements OnInit {\n\n    constructor(private translation: L10nTranslationService, private intl: L10nIntlService) { }\n\n    ngOnInit() {\n        this.translation.onChange().subscribe({\n            next: (locale: L10nLocale) => {\n                // Texts\n                this.greeting = this.translation.translate('greeting');\n                this.whoIAm = this.translation.translate('whoIAm', { name: 'Angular l10n' });\n                // Dates\n                this.formattedToday = this.intl.formatDate(this.today, { dateStyle: 'full', timeStyle: 'short' });\n                this.formattedTimeAgo = this.intl.formatRelativeTime(-4, 'second', { numeric: 'always', style: 'long' });\n                // Numbers\n                this.formattedValue = this.intl.formatNumber(\n                    1000,\n                    { digits: '1.2-2', style: 'currency' },\n                    undefined,\n                    undefined,\n                    convertCurrency,\n                    { rate: 1.16 }\n                );\n                this.formattedLength = this.intl.formatNumber(\n                    1,\n                    { digits: '1.0-2', style: 'unit', unit: locale.units['length'] },\n                    undefined,\n                    undefined,\n                    convertLength\n                );\n                this.formattedOnePlural = this.intl.plural(1, 'devs', { type: 'cardinal' });\n                this.formattedOtherPlural = this.intl.plural(2, 'devs', { type: 'cardinal' });\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n}\nL10nIntlService provides methods for all Intl APIs, including Collator & ListFormat.\n\nChanging the locale\nYou can change the locale at runtime at any time by calling the setLocale method of L10nTranslationService:\n{{ item.locale.language | l10nDisplayNames:locale.language:{ type: 'language' } }}export class AppComponent {\n\n    schema = this.l10nConfig.schema;\n\n    constructor(@Inject(L10N_CONFIG) private l10nConfig: L10nConfig, private translation: L10nTranslationService) { }\n\n    setLocale(locale: L10nLocale): void {\n        this.translation.setLocale(locale);\n    }\n\n}It is not mandatory to use the schema provided during the configuration: it is possible to set the language or currency, or any other property of L10nLocale separately.\nCustomize the library\nThe following features can be customized. You just have to implement the indicated class-interface and pass the token during configuration.\nE.g.\n@Injectable() export class HttpTranslationLoader implements L10nTranslationLoader {\n\n    private headers = new HttpHeaders({ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });\n\n    constructor(@Optional() private http: HttpClient) { }\n\n    public get(language: string, provider: L10nProvider): Observable {\n        const url = `${provider.asset}-${language}.json`;\n        const options = {\n            headers: this.headers,\n            params: new HttpParams().set('v', provider.options.version)\n        };\n        return this.http.get(url, options);\n    }\n\n}\n\nexport const l10nConfig: L10nConfig = {\n    ...\n    providers: [\n        { name: 'app', asset: './assets/i18n/app', options: { version: '1.0.0' } },\n    ],\n    ...\n};\n\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        L10nTranslationModule.forRoot(\n            l10nConfig,\n            {\n                translationLoader: HttpTranslationLoader\n            }\n        )\n    ],\n    ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Storage\nBy default, the library does not store the locale. To store it implement the L10nStorage class-interface using what you need, such as web storage or cookie, so that the next time the user has the locale he selected.\nUser Language\nBy default, the library attempts to set the locale using the user's browser language, before falling back on the default locale. You can change this behavior by implementing the L10nUserLanguage class-interface, for example to get the language via server.\nTranslation Loader\nBy default, you can only pass JavaScript objects as translation data provider. To implement a different loader, you can implement the L10nTranslationLoader class-interface, as in the example above.\nTranslation Fallback\nYou can enable translation fallback during configuration:\nexport const l10nConfig: L10nConfig = {\n    ...\n    fallback: true,\n    ...\n};By default, the translation data will be merged in the following order:\n\n'language'\n'language[-script]'\n'language[-script][-region]'\n\nTo change it, implement the L10nTranslationFallback class-interface.\nTranslation Handler\nBy default, the library only parse the params. L10nTranslationHandler is the class-interface to implement to modify the behavior.\nMissing Translation Handler\nIf a key is not found, the same key is returned. To return a different value, you can implement the L10nMissingTranslationHandler class-interface.\nLoader\nIf you need to preload some data before initialization of the library, you can implement the L10nLoader class-interface:\n@Injectable() export class AppLoader implements L10nLoader {\n    constructor(private translation: L10nTranslationService) { }\n\n    public async init(): Promise {\n        await ... // Some custom data loading action\n        await this.translation.init();\n    }\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        L10nTranslationModule.forRoot(\n            l10nConfig,\n            {\n                loader: AppLoader\n            }\n        ),\n    ],\n})or if you are using L10nRouting:\n@Injectable() export class AppRoutingLoader implements L10nLoader {\n    constructor(private routing: L10nRoutingService, private translation: L10nTranslationService) { }\n\n    public async init(): Promise {\n        await ... // Some custom data loading action\n        await this.routing.init();\n        await this.translation.init();\n    }\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        L10nRoutingModule.forRoot({\n            loader: AppRoutingLoader\n        })\n    ],\n})Validation\nThere are two directives, that you can use with Template driven or Reactive forms: l10nValidateNumber and l10nValidateDate. To use them, you have to implement the L10nValidation class-interface, and import it with the validation module:\n@Injectable() export class LocaleValidation implements L10nValidation {\n\n    constructor(@Inject(L10N_LOCALE) private locale: L10nLocale) { }\n\n    public parseNumber(value: string, options?: L10nNumberFormatOptions, language = this.locale.numberLanguage || this.locale.language): number | null {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    public parseDate(value: string, options?: L10nDateTimeFormatOptions, language = this.locale.dateLanguage || this.locale.language): Date | null {\n        ...\n    }\n\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        L10nValidationModule.forRoot({ validation: LocaleValidation })\n    ],\n    ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Routing\nYou can enable the localized routing importing the routing module after others:\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        L10nRoutingModule.forRoot()\n    ],\n    ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }A prefix containing the language is added to the path of each navigation, creating a semantic URL:\nbaseHref/[language][-script][-region]/path\n\nhttps://example.com/en/home\nhttps://example.com/en-US/homeIf the localized link is called, the locale is also set automatically.\nTo achieve this, the router configuration in your app is not rewritten: the URL is replaced, in order to provide the different localized contents both to the crawlers and to the users that can refer to the localized links.\nIf you don't want a localized routing for default locale, you can enable it during the configuration:\nexport const l10nConfig: L10nConfig = {\n    ...\n    defaultRouting: true\n};You can change the localized path, implementing the L10nLocation class-interface, and import it with the routing module:\n@Injectable() export class AppLocation implements L10nLocation {\n\n    public path(): string {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    public parsePath(path: string): string | null {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    public getLocalizedSegment(path: string): string | null {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    public toLocalizedPath(language: string, path: string): string {\n        ...\n    }\n\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n    ...\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        L10nRoutingModule.forRoot({ location: AppLocation })\n    ],\n    ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Lazy loading\nIf you want to add new providers to a lazy loaded module, you can use L10nResolver in your routing module:\nconst routes: Routes = [\n    ...\n    {\n        path: 'lazy',\n        loadChildren: () => import('./lazy/lazy.module').then(m => m.LazyModule),\n        resolve: { l10n: L10nResolver },\n        data: {\n            l10nProviders: [{ name: 'lazy', asset: './assets/i18n/lazy', options: { version: '1.0.0' } }]\n        }\n    }\n];Always import the modules you need:\n@NgModule({\n    declarations: [LazyComponent],\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        L10nTranslationModule\n    ]\n})\nexport class LazyModule { }Lazy loading with bundled data\nIf you are bundling translation data using the default L10nTranslationLoader, you can add translation providers to lazy modules by updating the configuration and calling the loadTranslation method:\nconst i18nLazyAsset = { 'en-US': {...}, 'it-IT': {...} };\n\nthis.translation.addProviders([{ name: 'lazy', asset: i18nLazyAsset}]);\nthis.translation.loadTranslation([{ name: 'lazy', asset: i18nLazyAsset}]);Caching\nEnable caching during configuration if you want to prevent reloading of the already loaded translation data:\nexport const l10nConfig: L10nConfig = {\n    ...\n    cache: true\n};Preloading data\nIf you need to preload some translation data, for example to use for missing values, L10nTranslationService exposes the translation data in the data attribute. You can merge data by calling the addData method:\n@Injectable() export class AppLoader implements L10nLoader {\n    constructor(private translation: L10nTranslationService, private translationLoader: L10nTranslationLoader) { }\n\n    public async init(): Promise {\n        await new Promise((resolve) => {\n            this.translationLoader.get('en-US', { name: 'app', asset: './assets/i18n/app', options: { version: '1.0.0' } })\n                .subscribe({\n                    next: (data) => this.translation.addData(data, 'en-US'),\n                    complete: () => resolve(null)\n                });\n        });\n        await this.translation.init();\n    }\n}Types\nAngular l10n types that it is useful to know:\n\nL10nLocale: contains a language, in the format language[-script][-region][-extension], where:\n\nlanguage: ISO 639 two-letter or three-letter code\nscript: ISO 15924 four-letter script code\nregion: ISO 3166 two-letter, uppercase code\nextension: 'u' (Unicode) extensions\n\n   Optionally:\n\ndateLanguage: alternative language to translate dates\nnumberLanguage: alternative language to translate numbers\ncurrency: ISO 4217 three-letter code\ntimezone: from the IANA time zone database\nunits: key value pairs of unit identifiers\n\n\nL10nFormat: shows the format of the language to be used for translations. The supported formats are: 'language' | 'language-script' | 'language-region' | 'language-script-region'. So, for example, you can have a language like en-US-u-ca-gregory-nu-latn to format dates and numbers, but only use the en-US for translations setting 'language-region'\n\nL10nDateTimeFormatOptions: the type of options used to format dates. Extends the Intl DateTimeFormatOptions interface, replacing the dateStyle and timeStyle attributes. See DateTimeFormat for more details on available options\n\nL10nNumberFormatOptions: the type of options used to format numbers. Extends the Intl NumberFormatOptions interface, adding the digits attribute. See NumberFormat for more details on available options\n\n\nIntl API\nTo format dates and numbers, this library uses Intl API\nCurrent browser support:\n\nECMAScript compatibility tables\nCan I use\nIntl\n\nIf you need to support previous versions of browsers, or to use newest features see Format.JS\nIntl API in Node.js\nTo use Intl in Node.js, check the support according to the version in the official documentation: Internationalization Support\nServer Side Rendering\nYou can find a complete sample app with @nguniversal/express-engine here\nSSR doesn't work out of the box, so it is important to know:\n\nsrc\\app\\universal-interceptor.ts: used to handle absolute URLs for HTTP requests on the server\nsrc\\app\\l10n-config.ts:\nAppStorage (implements L10nStorage): uses a cookie to store the locale client & server side\nAppUserLanguage (implements L10nUserLanguage): server side, negotiates the language through acceptsLanguages to get the user language when the app starts\n\n\n\nPrevious versions\n\nAngular v13 (Angular l10n v13.1.0)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v12 (Angular l10n v12.0.1)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v11 (Angular l10n v11.1.0)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v10 (Angular l10n v10.1.2)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v9 (Angular l10n v9.3.0)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v8 (Angular l10n v8.1.2)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v7 (Angular l10n v7.2.0)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v6 (Angular l10n v5.2.0)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v5 (Angular l10n v4.2.0)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v4 (Angular l10n v3.5.2)\n\nBranch\n\n\nAngular v2 (Angular l10n v2.0.11)\n\nBranch\n\n\n\nContributing\n\nFirst, install the packages & build the library:\nnpm install\nnpm run build:watch\nTesting:\nnpm run test:watch\nServing the sample app:\nnpm start\nServing the sample ssr app:\nnpm run dev:ssr\n\nLicense\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2015 Roberto Simonetti\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
